# BeeFinder Documentation

## 🐝 Project Overview

BeeFinder is a web application that generates realistic bee images using AI and provides educational content about local bee species. The app uses location and weather data to create contextually relevant bee photographs.

## 📁 Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation:
- **[Bee Image Generation System](bee-image-generation-system.md)** - Complete technical overview of the working system
- **[Development Setup Guide](development-setup.md)** - How to set up and run the project locally
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## ✅ Current Status

### Working Functionality:
- **✅ AI Image Generation**: Gemini AI creates realistic bee photographs
- **✅ Firebase Storage**: Images successfully uploaded and stored
- **✅ Public URLs**: Images accessible via public URLs
- **✅ Location Integration**: Uses real location and weather data
- **✅ Educational Content**: Provides bee species facts and identification
- **✅ Error Handling**: Robust retry logic for image generation
- **✅ Storage Rules**: Properly configured for public access

### Known Issues:
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes not applying in production (identified as purging issue)
- **Visual Design**: App appears basic/unstyled despite working functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Developers:
1. Read [Development Setup Guide](development-setup.md)
2. Follow the setup instructions
3. Test the image generation functionality
4. Refer to [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md) if issues arise

### For Future Coding Agents:
1. **Start with**: [Bee Image Generation System](bee-image-generation-system.md) to understand the working functionality
2. **Focus on**: The core AI image generation and storage system (fully working)
3. **UI Issues**: See troubleshooting guide for Tailwind CSS purging solutions
4. **Testing**: Use the development setup guide to test locally

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend (Cloud Functions):
- **Function**: `generateImageAndText`
- **APIs**: Gemini AI, OpenWeatherMap, Zippopotam.us
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage with public access
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js

### Frontend (React + Vite):
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with purging issues)
- **Build**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting

### Key Integrations:
- **Google Gemini AI**: Image and text generation
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Weather data
- **Zippopotam.us**: Location geocoding
- **Firebase**: Storage, hosting, functions

- **Educational Content**: Accurate bee species identification and facts

### 📈 Performance:
- **Generation Time**: ~10-15 seconds per image
- **Success Rate**: High with retry logic
- **Storage**: Efficient public URL generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks implemented

## 🔄 Git Workflow

### Current Branch:
- **Branch**: `bee-image-generation-success`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jynxmynx82/BeeFinder
- **Status**: Captures all working functionality

### Key Commits:
- **Initial**: Working bee image generation system
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage integration
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and fallbacks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for future agents

## 🛠️ Development Notes

### For Future Work:
1. **UI Styling**: Fix Tailwind CSS purging issues
